Project Description:

"Lost and Found" is a web app where you send anonymous messages as paper airplanes that land on random spots across a world map for others to discover. Each day, unlock a new country to scratch off, explore fun facts, and uncover hidden messages. Collect unique stamps for your virtual passport as you complete countries and unlock achievements, creating a personalized journey of global stories and connections.
